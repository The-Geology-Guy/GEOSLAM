The seismo-lineament analysis method is a tool to spatially correlate a shallow-focus earthquake to the surface trace of the fault that generated it. SLAM is the intellectual property and work product of Vince Cronin. The GEOSLAM Python code was a simple translation from Vince Cronin's Mathematica files, where this translation was performed by Luke Pajer.
